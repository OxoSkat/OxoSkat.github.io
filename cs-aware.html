            CS-Aware Cybersecurity Platform</h1>
        <p class="text-half">During my 2 months internship at Rheasoft I worked on a design for their cyber security platform CS-Aware. A product that stands on a foundation of knowledge gained through the EU project CS-Aware and the current EU project CS-Aware Next. The CS-Aware platform tries to tackle multiple issues identified through the EU projects at once. These include a lack of collaboration and information sharing between critical entities with in a EU country, A lack of insights about ones own system and vulnerabilities with in that system (which does include the people operating with in it). And last but not least the tools to act in time when an incident happens.</p>
        <span></span>
        <div class="padding"></div>
        <p class="text">From their first EU project. Rheasoft had build a prototype which I was tasked to redesign and build upon. I decided to build the design for six screen sizes. One for desktops, one for laptops, one for each orientation on tablet and one for each orientation on mobile. </p>
        <span></span>
        <p class="text">
            The final design ended up being in total 54 screen designs and 32 overlays across 6 resolutions. Beneath you will see the final design for desktop and after that I will take you through the work process.</p>

        <h2 class="subtitle">The Work Process</h2>
        <p class="text">After being given an introduction to Rheasoft, CS-Aware and their product I inquired about the types of users that the product was intended for. The main users would be system administrators responsible for larger companies IT-infrastructure. The secondary users would be manager who would use the product for reporting to their superiors about the state of their IT-infrastructure and incident handling.</p>
        <span></span>
        <p class="text">I then studied Rheasoft’s previous demo. This gave me a better overview of the features which was intended to be in the design. It’s important to state that the CS-Aware product is still in its early stages of development and some of the features might not make it through to the end product. Therefore I decided to include most features in my design and added a few which we had been discussing as potential viable features for the end product. This included a page for dashboards regarding social media posts and keywords/accounts being tracked and a sign in and sign up page. </p>
        <span></span>
        <h2 class="subtitle">Wireframing</h2>
        <p class="text">I started my design by making a set of wireframes for mobile and for desktop in order to get an idea of how i wanted elements to be placed in the screens.</p>

<div class="grid">
    <h2 class="subtitle">Atomic design, building with components</h2>
    <p class="text">After wireframing I started to set up my design document. I had decided to use the atomic design philosophy which i had gotten acquainted with during my time at Motostore. I started by creating the small building blocks of the design beginning with the basics such as colors and typography.</p>
    <div class="padding"></div>
    <img src="images/cs-aware/typography.png" alt="typography used in the cs-aware project" class="centered-img">
    <div class="padding"></div>
    <img src="images/cs-aware/colors.png" alt="colors used in the cs-aware project" class="centered-img">
    <div class="padding"></div>
    <p class="text">I created a group of buttons and gathered resources i would need for the design like icons and different logos.</p>
    <div class="padding"></div>
    <img src="images/cs-aware/buttons.png" alt="buttons used in the cs-aware project" class="large-img">
    <div class="padding"></div>
    <img src="images/cs-aware/tab-button.png" alt="tab buttons used in the cs-aware project" class="centered-img">
    <div class="padding"></div>
    <img src="images/cs-aware/icons.png" alt="icons used in the cs-aware project" class="large-img">
    <div class="padding"></div>
    <p class="text">There are many more components than this but instead of showcasing this project in full detail I would rather take you through the general design steps i took.</p>
    <span></span>
    <p class="text">In truth I oscilated between designing the pages and creating the basic components I needed on the go. But I always kept to the atomic design philosophy so that when I needed a basic component I would to the “Atoms” page and design it there as a component and then bring that component in to the page where i needed to use it. This strict design discipline is something that I started to lack in the final weeks of my internship and the importance of that discipline is a lesson that I bring with me from my time a Rheasoft.</p>
    <span></span>
    <p class="text">I very quickly needed to turn some of these atoms into molecules that i could use on the final design. One of the first molecules i created was the navigation bar which consisted of two atoms; the bar and the icons to represent the different pages.</p>
    <div class="padding"></div>
    <img src="images/cs-aware/navigation.png" alt="navigation components used to create the navigation bar" class="centered-img">
    <div class="padding"></div>
    <img src="images/cs-aware/navigation-bar.png" alt="navigation bars used in the cs-aware project" class="centered-img">
    <div class="padding"></div>
    <p class="text">The molecules I created differed in complexity. Some where as simple as inputs fields and other where rather complex overlays building upon many atoms. </p>
    <div class="padding"></div>
    <img src="images/cs-aware/input-field.png" alt="input fields used in the cs-aware project" class="centered-img">
    <div class="padding"></div>
    <img src="images/cs-aware/node-description.png" alt="node description overlay used in the cs-aware project" class="large-img">
    <div class="padding"></div>
    <p class="text">I used the overlay feature in figma more than i have ever before. Due to the fact that this time I was designing for a larger software and not a website it seemed fulfill a certain need.</p>
    <span></span>
    <p class="text">That need was configuration. The users of the software would mainly be system administrators and a lot of the value derived from the software would come from the way the user configured the software. Adding keywords and social media accounts would give the user insights onto new ransomwares and types of attacks. Configuring the dashboards would give him/her the insights needed at a quick glance. Sharing information and delegating responsibility over certain incidents would increase collaboration. Furthermore configuring the infrastructure map (which you will see later on) would increase awareness of ones own system.</p>
    <span></span>
    <h2 class="subtitle">Overlays</h2>
    <p class="text">The most complex overlay I created was also an organism. Meaning it used molecules with in it. This was an overlay for the threat and overview page.</p>
    <div class="padding"></div>
    <img src="images/cs-aware/threat-overlay.png" alt="threat overlay used in the cs-aware project" class="large-img">
    <div class="padding"></div>
    <p class="text">The complexity of this overlay is due to the fact that it had to consist of, among other things, three tabs (history, course of action and observed data) which each had its own table of contents. As I explained earlier it is used to describe incidents found in the table of contents on the threats and overview page.</p>
    <div class="padding"></div>
    <img src="images/cs-aware/threats-overlay.gif" alt="gif of the threat overlay in the cs-aware project" class="centered-img">
    <div class="padding"></div>
    <p class="text">The infrastructure page as I mentioned earlier used multiple overlays and is a design that I am quite fond of myself. It is the page that gives the user an overview of their own system and where attacks happen with in that system.</p>
    <span></span>
    <p class="text">The user configures this system themselves using premade or custom made templates. Dragging connections between the nodes to show how the information flows between nodes. The mini-map in the bottom left lets the user know where they are in the map and lets them quickly navigate large systems. The three buttons at the top left corner allows the user to zoom in and out as well as reset the zoom. Right above those buttons the user can search for tags which are applied to the nodes and can also access a full list of tags. </p>
    <span></span>
    <p class="text">Clicking a node will make an overlay appear that gives the user a description of that node including incidents/social media posts related to the node and the list of tags connected to the node.</p>
    <div class="padding"></div>
    <img src="images/cs-aware/node-description.gif" alt="gif of the node description overlay in the cs-aware project" class="centered-img">
    <div class="padding"></div>
    <p class="text">On the far right side there is a tab with three buttons. The arrow expands the bar to show all current templates that the user can drag onto the map to create a new node. The + icon opens an overlay that lets the user add a new template and the last icon lets the user import a template increasing the potential to collaborate.</p>
    <div class="padding"></div>
    <img src="images/cs-aware/map-side-bar.gif" alt="gif of the side bar overlay in the cs-aware project" class="centered-img">
    <div class="padding"></div>
    <p class="text">One of the pages that I created which was not in the prototype Rheasoft had build was the social media dashboard page.</p>
    <div class="padding"></div>
    <img src="images/cs-aware/dashboard-edit-dashboard.gif" alt="gif of the edit dashboard overlay in the cs-aware project" class="centered-img">
    <div class="padding"></div>
    <img src="images/cs-aware/dashboard-side-bar.gif" alt="gif of the dashboard side bar overlay in the cs-aware project" class="centered-img">
    <div class="padding"></div>
    <p class="text">Furthermore i created a social media page which had a pretty basic table of contents and two overlays. One showed a social media post when you clicked on a specific row in the tables. The other was an overlay to manage the keywords and account you were tracking on social media.</p>
    <img src="images/cs-aware/social-media-post-overlay.gif" alt="gif of the social media post overlay in the cs-aware project" class="centered-img">
    <div class="padding"></div>
    <img src="images/cs-aware/social-media-add-keyword-account.gif" alt="gif of the social media add tracked keywords and accounts overlay in the cs-aware project" class="centered-img">
    <div class="padding"></div>
    <p class="text">There are three main lessons i will bring with me from this project is first of all the design discipline is really important. During the last week of my internship i promised to deliver three pages for the full version of the software which were not going to be included in the lite version. These were the threats page, the overview page and the information sharing page. Due to the small time frame i ended up unintentionally desiging without the atomic design philosophy in mind which ended up costing me in the end when i wanted to redesign parts of the table contents. Changing a color on the header of table of contents suddenly took way more time than it had to. I also were too careless with how i spaced elements. I should have followed a rule of how much spacing i used which sometimes ended up being judged only by feeling instead of by feeling and then commonality.</p>
    <span></span>
    <p class="text">The second lesson is to think HTML and CSS way more when i design. This means using the automatic layout function way more than i already do as it will give a better CSS output from figma elements. It also means using frames for creating boxes instead of rectangles as this mimics the &lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; in HTML better.</p>
    <span></span>
    <p class="text">The third lesson is a better understanding of how to deliver a design to developers. Since no one one the team had experience with it i had to rely on internet articles and experience from people with in my network. In the end i found that i went too much in to detail and wasted some time that i could have really used earlier on. But i am now much wiser about how to deliver a design and how to design for delivery as well.</p>
