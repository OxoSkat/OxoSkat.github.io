        <p class="text">During my internship at the Institute for Public Health I worked on a project called HealthD360 that aimed to combine health data from danish citizensâ€™ phones and wearables with health data available from the danish public health system. The project was working with two cases. One case on mental health for children and young adults and a case on treatment of wound for elderly. I worked on the case with mental health for children and young adults. We held workshops with professionals from hospitals, overweight clinics, teachers, social workers and psychologists. One of these workshops were held in the municipality of Favrskov. I worked on planning the workshop and during the workshop I took notes from the conversations the participants had and took some photos.</p>

        <p class="text">This specific workshop was looking into how data could help students with low attendence in school. The workshop was divided in to two parts. During the first part the participants discussed the reasons for low attendance. The insights was as follows:</p>
        <ul class="in-text-list">
            <li>Lack of social or educational resources for the child</li>
            <li>Problems in the home causing despair for the child</li>
            <li>Undiscovered diagnoses</li>
            <li>Loneliness and isolation</li>
            <li>Too many demands for the child</li>
        </ul>

<div class="padding"></div>
    <div class="grid">
        <p class="text">The second part of the workshop mixed the groups up and gave them the assignment to discuss potential solutions based on their previous discussions. Some of the insights that could be incorporated into the HealthD360 project was:</p>
        <ul class="in-text-list">
            <li>Sharing of data on attendance between teachers and school nurses to increase collaboration</li>
            <li>Data about sleep and activity might be able to help on mental health</li>
            <li>Adaptive algorithms to set the right goals for children (in terms of scale)</li>
            <li>Counting tags on social media in order to pin point children who might be socially isolated</li>
            <li>A system that allows children to report their mood when entering class (like red, yellow and green buttons)</li>
            <li>The insight were used for a later workshop in Hammel that focused on concepts.</li>
        </ul>
